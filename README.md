# constexpr-singly-linked-BST
Hi all - I'd like to introduce my version of singly linked constexpr binary search tree. It has tested on VS2019(v142 msvc)/16.3.6/std:c++latest
environment.
I have a little bit of experience writing scripts for cad in VBA/C# and I haven't worked in real production with srcugile/hoverboards (&smoothies?).
Also the project uses many temp variables and classes, so itâ€™s not suitable for intended use in a real production code.
it is only for education, getting a fan... etc
I found only few examples of not constexpr BST in the internet. So, I hope it will be interesting to you too. Don't kick me hard, I'm just learning :)
